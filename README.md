# Main Topics Relating To Agentic Ai:

* Messages refer to the prompt given to the gpt model, in return we get a response.The prompt should be as accurate as possible for better responses.

* Models are basically different types of gpt-api higher models are more costly but provide much better functionality and capabilities. The number of character that constitutes one token differ for each model

* Max Completion Tokens refer to maximum characters a response can have, it differs from model to model where higher models provide more flexibility

* n refer to the number of different responses api provides us from a given prompt for example it provides us three different response if we set the value n=3

* Stream means that content is generated slowly as if it was a live discussion if we set stream to false the text would be produced all at once

* Temprature basically how advanced or creative response api will give us, if the value is set to low it will give us a simple response altho if the value is set higher the response will be more complex

* Top_p is used to set probability for selection of words in a response, if the value is set higher response will more likely consists of words more relevant to the prompt

* Tools can be implemented with api to provide further capability or functionality, some types are function calling means using your specific functions, or tool to go through files, or it can have tools to run python code
