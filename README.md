# Main Topics Relating To Agentic Ai:

* Messages refer to the prompt given to the gpt model, in return we get a response.The prompt should be as accurate as possible for better responses.

* Models are basically different types of gpt-api higher models are more costly but provide much better functionality and capabilities. The number of character that constitutes one token differ for each model

* Max Completion Tokens refer to maximum characters a response can have, it differs from model to model where higher models provide more flexibility

* n refer to the number of different responses api provides us from a given prompt for example it provides us three different response if we set the value n=3

* Stream means that content is generated slowly as if it was a live discussion if we set stream to false the text would be produced all at once

* Temprature basically how advanced or creative response api will give us, if the value is set to low it will give us a simple response altho if the value is set higher the response will be more complex

* Top_p is used to set probability for selection of words in a response, if the value is set higher response will more likely consists of words more relevant to the prompt

* Tools can be implemented with api to provide further capability or functionality, some types are function calling means using your specific functions, or tool to go through files, or it can have tools to run python code

# Key API And Software Components

* API are act as messangers, they help communicate your messages. They work by hiding the inner working of a system. For example digital transactions and other functionalities that require online communcation.

* SDK refers to software development kits, they are essentially list of tools that developers using while working or creating projects.

* Web API basically work over the internet, providing responsed and sending requests.

* Library API refers to set of prewritten or define code or functions that can easily be integrated into any programming language.

* Promting means to send a request to API that could be a simple question such as what Temprature is it today or asking it to generate a image and the Response refers to the output we get in return.
